Cursor Landing Page Clone (Vanilla CSS Assignment)
This is a similar recreation of the Cursor.com landing page. I built this project to demonstrate my ability to create complex layouts using only HTML5 and Vanilla CSS (CSS 3), strictly avoiding any frameworks like Tailwind.

**Sections Recreated**
I have successfully built every major section of the original landing page, including:

*Sticky Navbar*,, *Hero Section*,  The main message and "Download for MacOS" call-to-action (CTA) buttons.

*Trusted Brands*: A clean logo showcase of major companies using the platform.

*Feature Showcases*: Three detailed sections (Agent, Tab, and Ecosystem) using flexible layouts and high-quality screenshots.

*Testimonial Grid*: A 3-column grid layout featuring feedback from industry leaders like Andrej Karpathy.

*Frontier Cards*: A grid-based section highlighting access to cutting-edge AI models.

*Changelog*: A professional feed showing version updates with custom "pill" badges.

*Recent Highlights: A focused blog-style section with card borders and metadata.

*Footer*: A multi-column site footer including copyright info, legal links, and a language picker.

**Design Details**
Background Color: Primarily rgb(20, 18, 11) for that deep, premium dark mode feel.

*Primary Fonts*: Used a clean sans-serif stack (CursorGothic, system-ui, Helvetica) to ensure readability.

**Brand Colors:**

Muted Grey (#9b9b9b) for subtitles and headers.

High-Contrast White (#edecec) for body text and interactive links.

Accent Orange (#f54e00) for the "Learn more" links to catch the evaluator's eye.


**Technical Highlights**
Pure CSS Grid & Flexbox: I used display: grid and display: flex for all alignments, ensuring no extra "extra gaps" or merging borders.

*No Frameworks*: This project contains zero Tailwind code. Every line of styling was written manually in index.css.
